# AtWork
Ionic2 application that replaces an employee time clock, When you enters a company's building the application will automatically send a POST-request to my API server, this server can handle all the incoming data(deviceID, time, date) and put it nicely into a mysql-database. Just the same when you leaves a company's building, the application will send a DELETE-request to my API server. it's not possible to use the GET and PUT requests! And as extra protection I use the TouchID to verify your movement.
I also designed a webpage with his own build-in dashboard, here the employer can check in realtime who's working right now. This is very useful in cases of fire, emergency, ...
